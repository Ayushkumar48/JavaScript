        <h2 class="h2">Amer Fort / Amber Fort</h2>
        <div class="descript">
            <p>Amber fort or Amer Fort is located at about eleven kilometres north of the city of Jaipur along the NH-8. The fort was constructed on the Kalikho hills formed by the Aravalli ranges. The fort was tactically built amidst the Aravalli ranges along with the Maotha lake and the Sagar lake. Numerous points along NH-8 provide a breathtaking view of the fort as it is mirrored simultaneously in the Maotha Lake.</p>

            <img src="https://www.jaipurstuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/amer-fort-jaipur.jpg" width="800px">

            <p>The fort was established in the 16th century by the Kachhwaha rulers but only after they had destroyed the older structures that had been constructed by the Meena clan. The primary attractions in the fort are: (a) Diwan-e-Am (b)Diwan-e-Khas (c)Ganesh Pol (d)Jaleb Chowk (e)Singh Pol (f)Jai Mandir (g)Yash Mandir (h)Sukh Mandir (i) Sheesh Mahal (j)Suhag Mandir (k)Sila Devi Temple (l)Bhool Bhulaiya and (m)Zanana Dyodhi.</p>

            <p>The construction of the Amer fort first began with Raja Bharmal and Raja Man Singh I in 1558. The fort was completed over a period of two centuries after the consistent efforts of three kings, finally ending in 1727 by Raja Sawai Jai Singh II. Amer fort was designated as the new residence for the royal family as opposed to the older establishment of Jaigarh Fort.</p>             

            <p>However, both the Amer and Jaigarh forts are often considered to be a single establishment due to the common passageway that runs between them. The Jaigarh fort was a retreat for the royal family as well as their attendants in times of war. The Jaigarh fort was also known as the Kadimi Mahal or the “old palace”.</p>

            <p>Amber was earlier known as Dhundar and had been the capital of the Meena clan. The Kachhwaha rulers seized it from the Meenas and began the construction of the Amer fort in the 1600s. There are multiple etymologies provided so far for the name “Amber”.</p>

            <p>Multiple stories include it being named after Ambikeshwar, the title of Lord Shiva, whose symbolic representation, the linga, was placed in a lake in the center of the Amber. The Jain inscriptions of the 16th and 17th centuries talk about the derivation of the name from the name of Goddess Ambavati. Another tale claims that the name was derived from Amba, the universal mother.</p>

            <p>Although there exists no inscription validating the fact that a war was fought by the Kachwaha and the Meena's during which the settlement came under the Kachhwaha rule, however, according to a popular folklore, Dhola Rae, the adopted nephew of Raja Alan Singh, the then ruler of Amber, slaughtered the Meena clan on the day of Diwali.</p>

            <p>The Kachhwaha clan is believed to be the descendants of Kush, the second son of Lord Ram. One of his descendants was Raja Nal, whose son, Raja Sora Singh was killed in a war. His widow was found plucking wild berries by a Brahmin who, after looking at the baby, predicted a bright future. She then sought refuge in the kingdom of Khogong, presently known as Amber, which was led by Raja Alan Singh.</p>

            <p>He adopted her as his sister and the child, Dhola Rae as his nephew. At the age of 14, Dhola Rae was sent to Delhi to learn about politics. Upon his return, he brought his own army of Kachhwahas to claim the throne of Amber. According to a ritual called Pitra Tarpan, the Meenas had to set their weapons aside and taking advantage of this opportunity, they were attacked and the settlement of Amber came under the Kachhwaha rulers.</p>
