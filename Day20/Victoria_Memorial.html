        <h2 class="h2">Victoria Memorial</h2>
        <div class="descript">
            <p>If there is one place in Kolkata that should top everyone’s list of places to visit, it is the Victoria Memorial, one of the finest pieces of architecture. In the heart of the bustling metro city of Kolkata, Victoria Memorial stands as a reminiscence of erstwhile colonial grandeur.</p>

            <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/6210324/pexels-photo-6210324.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-kulish-rawal-6210324.jpg&fm=jpg" width="800px">

            <p>The white marble monument is a perfect representation of sheer magnificence that entices its visitors and leaves them awestruck. The idea of the monument was conceptualized by Lord George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston and Viceroy of India as a ‘stately’ memorial for deceased Queen Victoria, the first Empress of British India.</p>

            <p>Built as a memorial, the monument now serves as a museum that houses original artefacts that once belonged to the Empress Queen. Other than these, the gallery also displays a host of valuable collection of paintings and original manuscripts, as well as memorabilia of viceroys and governor generals who held important administrative positions during the Raj. The memorial gallery and the gardens surrounding its premises are spread across an area of 64 acres.</p>             

            <p>As one walks through the corridors of the hall, a certain sense of pride fills in just by imagining what might these corridors look like when royalty or dignitaries strolled around.</p>

            <p>William Emerson, the then President of the Royal Institute of British Architects was the chief architect of Victoria Memorial, and built it out of white Makrana marble, sourced from Jodhpur in Rajasthan, India. He was assisted by supervising architect, Vincent Esch. The architecture of the heritage monument is based on Indo- Saracenic revivalist style with a mix of influences from Egyptian, Venetian, Deccan and Islamic elements. The construction of the memorial was commissioned to Messrs, Martin & Co. of Calcutta.</p>

            <p>The memorial stands at a height of 200 feet including 16 feet height of the ‘Angel of Victory’ placed on top of the central dome. The ‘Angel of Victory’ is mounted on huge ball bearings on top of the central dome which rotate with the wind. Four allegorical sculptures namely, Art, Architecture, Justice and Charity surround the central dome. Three more allegorical structures, Motherhood, Learning and Prudence, are placed just above the front façade or north porch. All the allegorical sculptures were sculpted in and shipped from Italy.</p>

            <p>The royal coat of arms is sculpted just above the arched entrance of the gallery. The central dome has four subsidiary octagonal domed chhatris clustered at lower level and four domed towers at four corners of the edifice along with high portals and roof. Two massive marble lion statues at the main entrance of memorial grounds represent power. A colossal bronze statue of the Queen Empress stands a few metres away from the main entrance of the garden grounds. The bronze statue was sculpted in England by Sir George Frampton and shipped all the way to India. Coming to the design of Victoria Memorial Gardens, the lustrous lawns and gardens encircling the memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Vincent Esch, Emerson’s supervising architect, went on to design the most interesting parts of the heritage structure – the bridge of north aspect and garden gates. There are two large pools that adorn the memorial gardens.</p>

            <p>Upon the death of Queen Victoria in January of 1901, the then Viceroy of British India, Lord Curzon proposed to build a state memorial in the form of a grand white marble building to commemorate her reign as the Empress of India. The foundation stone of the building was laid by the then Prince of Wales, King George V on January 04, 1906. Apart from being a monument to the queen primarily, Lord Curzon was also interested in opening the memorial hall to public as a national gallery that would display few personal belongings of the queen.</p>

            <p>The total cost of construction of the memorial amounted to 1,05,00,000 Indian Rupees. The entire amount came from the funds of Indian princes and native states. It was their way of paying tribute to the queen. A small portion of the funds also came from the British government in London. Though the ground work had started in 1906, it took 15 long years to complete work on the memorial since Curzon left India following an unrest and opposition after the partition of Bengal in 1905. That led the construction to move at a much slower pace and by the time the monument was opened to the public in 1921, the capital of British India had shifted to Delhi from Calcutta. The memorial was inaugurated by the Duke of Windsor, Edward VIII. The place where the memorial was built, was earlier the location of Presidency jail which was demolished to make way for the memorial. The staff and inmates of the jail were later relocated to Alipore.</p>
